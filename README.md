# Î»# AdventureBot - June 2017 Team Hackathon Challenge
AdventureBot is an [Amazon Alexa Skill](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit) for powering voice-based adventures on Alexa-enabled devices. AdventureBot includes a game library, an AWS lambda function, a command line utility, and an Alexa Skill definition to get you going as quickly as possible.

### Pre-requisites
The following tools and accounts are required to complete these instructions.

* [Install .NET Core 1.x](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
* [Install AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [Sign-up for an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Sign-up for an Amazon developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/)

### Running the AdventureBot command line app
1. Restore solution packages: `dotnet restore`
2. Change folder the command line project: `cd AdventureBot.Cli`
3. Run app with a sample file: `dotnet run ../assets/sample-adventure.json`

## LEVEL 1 - Setup AdventureBot Alexa Skill
The following steps set up the Alexa Skill with an invocation name, a predefined set of voice commands, and associates it with the AdventureBot lambda function.

1. [Log into the Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/home.html)
2. Click on the `ALEXA` tab
3. Click on Alexa Skill Kit `Get Started`
4. Click `Add a New Skill`
5. *Skill Information*
    1. Under name put: `AdventureBot`
    2. Under invocation name put: `Adventure Bot`
    3. Click `Save`
    4. Click `Next`
6. *Interaction Model*
    1. Click `Launch Skill Builder`
    2. Click `Discard` to proceed
    3. Click `</> Code` in left navigation
    4. Upload `assets/alexa-skill.json` file
    5. Click `Apply Changes`
    6. Click `Build Mode` in the toolbar
    7. Click `Configuration`
7. *Configuration*
    1. Select `AWS lambda ARN (Amazon Resource Name)`
    2. Select `North America`
    3. Paste in the AWS lambda function ARN: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:******:function:LambdaSharp-AlexaEcho`
    4. Click `Next`
8. **Congratulations!!** Your Alexa Skill is now available on all your registered Alexa-devices, including the Amazon mobile app. Give it a whirl!
    * For Alexa devices, say: `Alexa, open Adventure Bot`
    * For the Amazon mobile app, click the microphone icon, and say: `open Adventure Bot`
    * Then say, `describe`, `hint`, `yes`, or any other custom and built-in intents.
    * Say `quit` to exit the skill.

## LEVEL 2 - Deploy AdventureBot Lambda Function

### Create `lambdasharp` AWS Profile
The project uses by default the `lambdasharp` profile. Follow these steps to setup a new profile if need be.

1. Create a `lambdasharp` profile: `aws configure --profile lambdasharp`
2. Configure the profile with the AWS credentials you want to use
3. **NOTE**: AWS Lambda function for Alexa Skills must be deployed in `us-east-1`

### Create `LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa` role for the lambda function
The `LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa` lambda function requires an IAM role to access CloudWatchLogs, S3, SNS, and DynamoDB. You can create the `LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa` role via the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) or use the executing [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) commands.

```shell
aws iam create-role --profile lambdasharp --role-name LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa --assume-role-policy-document file://assets/lambda-role-policy.json
aws iam attach-role-policy --profile lambdasharp --role-name LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess
aws iam attach-role-policy --profile lambdasharp --role-name LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsFullAccess
aws iam attach-role-policy --profile lambdasharp --role-name LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSNSFullAccess
aws iam attach-role-policy --profile lambdasharp --role-name LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
```

### Upload AdventureBot JSON file
The AdventureBot lambda function reads the adventure definition from a JSON file that must be uploaded to S3. Follow these steps to create a new bucket and upload a sample adventure file.

1. Create an S3 bucket or reuse an existing one (e.g. `my-adventurebot-bucket`)
2. Create an `AdventureBot` folder
3. Upload `assets/sample-adventure.json` file into the `AdventureBot` folder

### Publish the AdventureBot lambda function
The AdventureBot lambda function needs to be compiled and published to AWS `us-east-1`. The default publishing settings are in `aws-lambda-tools-defaults.json` file and assume the `lambdasharp` profile. Once published, the lambda function needs to be configured to be ready for invocation by the Alexa Skill.

1. Change folder to the lambda function: `cd AdventureBot.Alexa`
2. Publish the lambda function: `dotnet lambda deploy-function`
3. [Go to the published lambda function in the console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa?tab=code)
4. Copy the AWS Lambda function ARN for later (e.g. `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:******:function:LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa`)
5. Under `Code` > `Environment Variables`
    1. Add key: `adventure_file`
    2. Add value pointing to the JSON file (replace with your bucket name and file path): `s3://lambdasharp/AdventureBot/sample-adventure.json`
    3. Click `Save`
6. Under `Triggers`
    1. Click `Add Trigger`
    2. Select `Alexa Skills Kit`
    3. Click `Submit` (**NOTE**: if `Submit` is grayed out, select `Alexa Smart Home` trigger instead and then select `Alexa Skills Kit` trigger again)

#### Update the Alexa kill
Finally, the Alexa Sill needs to be updated to point to the AdventureBot lambda function.

(e.g. `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:******:function:LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa`)

1. [Log into the Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/home.html)
2. Click on the `ALEXA` tab
3. Click on Alexa Skill Kit `Get Started`
4. Click on `AdventureBot`
7. Click on `Configuration`
3. Update the AWS lambda function with the ARN you copied from the AdventureBot lambda function: (e.g. `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:******:function:LambdaSharp-AdventureBotAlexa`)
4. Click `Save`

## APPENDIX A - AdventureBot File Format
The AdventureBot uses a simple JSON file to define places. Each place has a description and a list of choices that are available to the player.

### Main
The main object has only one field called `"places"`.

* `"places"`: Map of place IDs to place objects. This map must contain a place called `"start"`.

```json
{
    "places": { ... }
}
```

### Place
The place object has multiple fields. All of them are required.

* `"description"`: Text describing the place/situation the player is in. This text is automatically read when the player first enters a place and can be repeated with the built-in *describe* command.
* `"instructions"`: Text describing the actions the player can provide. This text is automatically read when the player first enters a place and can be repeated with the built-in *help* command.
* `"choices"`: Map of choices to actions the player can make.

```json
{
    "description": "You are in a room.",
    "instructions": "To go North, say 1.",
    "choices": { ... }
}
```

### Choices
The choice object associates a command with zero or more actions. The field name must be one of the recognized commands:
* `"1"` through `"9"`
* `"yes"` and `"no"`
* `"help"`
* `"hint"`
* `"restart"`
* `"quit"`

```json
{
    "yes": [ ... ],
    "no": [ ... ]
}
```

### Actions
The action object associates an action with an argument. The field name must be one of the recognized actions:

* `"say"`: Says one or more sentences.
* `"pause"`: Pause the output for a while.
* `"play"`: Play an MP3 file.

#### Say Action
The say action converts text into speech.

```json
{
    "say": [ "You open the door." ]
}
```

#### Pause Action
The pause action is delays further speech for the specified duration in seconds.

```json
{
    "pause": [ 0.5 ]
}
```

#### Play Action
The play action plays back an MP3 file. The URL to the MP3 file must use a https:// link.

```json
{
    "play": [ "https://example.org/door-close.mp3" ]
}
```
